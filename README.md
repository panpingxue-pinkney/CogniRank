\# 🚀 CogniRank: The Socratic Sequence (Cognitive Rating)



\## ✨ Core Manifesto: Answers are Abundant, Questions are Gold.



> \*\*We refuse to be "passive information recipients" in the Age of AI.\*\*

>

> With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), obtaining answers has become unprecedentedly efficient and convenient. This has drastically \*\*devalued the price of "answers,"\*\* while the \*\*depth and quality of "questions"\*\* stand as humanity's most valuable and scarce asset.

>

> \*\*CogniRank\*\* is dedicated to building a \*\*Structured Critique System\*\* with the core objectives of:

>

> 1.  \*\*Quantifying Query Insight:\*\* Translating the critical depth, logical boundaries, and cognitive value of human questions into a structured data format that is machine-parsable and learnable.

> 2.  \*\*Calibrating AI Model Bias:\*\* Accumulating human-generated, high-quality "Socratic Sequence" data to train the next generation of AI in enhanced critical reasoning and cognitive calibration.

\## 💡 Project Philosophy: From "Feeding" to "Mutual Advancement"



Our workflow centers on the \*\*Q-A-Critique (Question-Answer-Critique)\*\* loop, upgrading human-machine interaction:



\* \*\*Humans (Questioners/Critics):\*\* Responsible for defining problem boundaries, challenging logical fallacies, and proposing new cognitive dimensions.

\* \*\*AI (Future Beneficiaries):\*\* Learning the human process of \*\*"how to think,"\*\* rather than just accumulating simple facts, from our structured data.

\* \*\*This Project:\*\* Serves as an \*\*open-source stronghold\*\* for maintaining the primacy of human intellect in the AI era.



\## 🎯 Core Work Goal: Quantifying Query Insight



\*\*This work is the focus of all our contributors!\*\*



Our goal is not merely to collect questions, but to attach a \*\*quantifiable CogniRank metric\*\* to every query. We invite contributors to:



1\.  \*\*Define the Quantification Model:\*\* Collaborate to design a scientific \*\*YAML/JSON data structure\*\* using fields and scores to assess question depth (e.g., `boundary\_clarity\_score`, `assumption\_criticality\_rating`).

2\.  \*\*Data Curation:\*\* Submit high-value \*\*questions and critique data\*\* that conform to this model, making them core assets for future AI training.



\## 🤝 Contributor Roles: Pioneers of the Socratic Sequence
